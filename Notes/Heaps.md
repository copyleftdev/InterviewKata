Key benefit: 0(1) lookup find-max, 0(logn) insertion, and 0{log n) deletion of max. Node and array representations. Min-heap variant.

A heap is a data structure based on a binary tree. It efficiently implements an ADT called a priority queue. A priority queue resembles a queue, with one difference: each element has a "priority" associated with it, and deletion removes the element with the highest priority.
Suppose you are given a set of files, each containing stock trade information. Each trade appears as a separate line containing information about that trade. Lines begin with an integer-valued timestamp, and lines within a file are sorted in increasing order of timestamp. Suppose you were asked to design an algorithm that combines the set of files into a single file R in which trades are sorted by timestamp.
This problem can be solved by a multistage merge process, but there is a trivial solution based on a min-heap data structure. Entries are trade-file pairs and are ordered by the timestamp of the trade. Initially the min-heap contains the first trade from each file. Iteratively delete the minimum entry e = (t,f) from the min-heap, write f to R, and add in the next entry in the file f
