Key benefit: 0(1) insertions, deletions and lookups. Key disadvantages: not suitable for order related queries; need for resizing; poor worst case performance. Understand implementation using array of buckets and collision chains. Know hash functions for integers, strings, objects. Understand importance of equals function. Variants such as Bloom filters.


A hash table is a data structure used to store keys, optionally with corresponding values. Inserts, deletes and lookups run in 0(1) time on average. One caveat is that these operations require a good hash functionâ€”a mapping from the set of all possible keys to the integers which is similar to a uniform random assignment. Another is that if the number of keys that is to be stored is not known in advance then the hash table needs to be periodically resized, which depending on how the resizing is implemented, can lead to some updates having 0(n) complexity.
Suppose you were asked to write an application that compares n programs for plagiarism. Specifically, your application is to break every program into overlapping character strings, each of length 100, and report on the number of strings that appear in each pair of programs. A hash table can be used to perform this check very efficiently if the right hash function is used
